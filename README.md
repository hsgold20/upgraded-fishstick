# Practice Building a custom operating system

 Task, 2 months: 

## 1. Arrays:
Explanation: Arrays are a fundamental data structure that store elements in contiguous memory locations. They are versatile and used for various problems.

LeetCode Problems:
1. Two Sum (Problem #1)
2. Maximum Subarray (Problem #53)
3. Rotate Array (Problem #189)

## 2. Fast & Slow Pointers:
Explanation: This pattern uses two pointers to traverse a sequence at different speeds (fast and slow), often used to detect cycles or find a specific position in the sequence.
LeetCode Problems:

1. Linked List Cycle (Problem #141)
2. Linked List Cycle II (Problem #142)
3. Middle of the Linked List (Problem #876)

## 3. Two Pointers️:
Explanation: Two Pointers involve maintaining two pointers in the collection and manipulating them to solve the problem efficiently.

LeetCode Problems:
1. Container With Most Water (Problem #11)
2. 3Sum (Problem #15)
3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Problem #26)

## 4. In-place Traversal of Linked List:
Explanation: In-place traversal of a linked list involves modifying the linked list nodes without using extra space. It’s often used to reverse a linked list or perform other transformations.

LeetCode Problems:
1. Reverse Linked List (Problem #206)
2. Rotate List (Problem #61)
3. Swap Nodes in Pairs (Problem #24)

## 5. Merge Intervals:
Explanation: This pattern involves merging overlapping intervals in a collection, often used in problems dealing with intervals or ranges.

LeetCode Problems:
1. Merge Intervals (Problem #56)
2. Insert Interval (Problem #57)
3. Meeting Rooms (Problem #252)
